# Hnefatafl AI

## The Game

Hnefatafl is a non-symmetric game where the Attackers (Black) try to completely surround the king (Yellow) before the Defenders (White) manage to move the king to one of the corners. Either team can capture an opponents piece by surrounding it on both sides. All pieces, including the king, move like rooks in chess. Only the king can be on the corner squares or the square in the middle.
